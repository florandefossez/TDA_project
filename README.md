# TDA_project

This is an academic project focused on Topological Data Analysis and Machine Learning. The goal of this project is to understand the concepts of TDA and illustrate them in a notebook (report). Moreover, this project includes two applications to orbit and graph classification problems.

Thanks to Bertrand Michel, teacher at the Ecole Centrale de Nantes, for having followed the project with us.
